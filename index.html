                    <h3>Image Generation using GAN, WGAN, DCGAN - A comparative analysis</h3>
                    <p>This project involves a comparative study of Basic GAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. The study evaluates the performance of these GAN architectures by analyzing key outputs such as generated images and loss plots. Basic GANs, while pioneering in generative modeling, often suffer from challenges like mode collapse, where the generator produces limited diversity in outputs, and vanishing gradients, which hinder the generator's ability to learn effectively during training. These issues are particularly pronounced when training deep networks, as the discriminator becomes too strong, leading to unstable learning dynamics.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, WGANs address these problems by replacing the traditional loss function with the Wasserstein distance, which provides more stable gradients, helping the generator update more effectively even when the critic (discriminator) is strong. DCGANs, on the other hand, leverage convolutional layers to improve feature extraction, leading to sharper and more realistic images. My analysis shows that both WGAN and DCGAN mitigated common pitfalls of Basic GANs, leading to more stable training, better gradient flow, and improved diversity in generated outputs. This project highlights the practical advantages of WGANs and DCGANs in overcoming the limitations of basic GAN architectures.</p>

                    <h3>Communities and Crime: Machine Learning Predictions and Classification</h3>
                    <p>Conducted a detailed comparative analysis of three machine learning models – Decision Trees, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) – to predict community crime rates. The dataset, amalgamating socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR, comprised 128 socio-economic features. I initiated the exploration by preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and dropping non-numeric columns. The subsequent exploratory data analysis provided insights into the dataset's structure. For Decision Trees, I implemented a model with entropy-based splitting, optimizing its max depth for better accuracy. AdaBoost, an ensemble method, was then explored with varying max depth values. Finally, I delved into Multiclass SVM, adjusting parameters like learning rate and regularization strength, and scrutinized its accuracy over different epochs. The project culminated in a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance, aiding in the selection of an optimal algorithm for crime rate prediction in communities. Notably, this project was accomplished without resorting to machine learning libraries like sklearn (scikit-learn), emphasizing a pure Python approach.

                    <br><br>
                    For time series analysis, I explored machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Gaussian Process Regression, and Facebook's Prophet model to predict future pellet size variations.
                    <br><br>
                    The outcomes hold immense significance for the pelletization industry, enabling real-time pellet distribution visualization and accurate size forecasts. This empowers manufacturers to optimize critical process parameters like feed rate of iron ore and organic binders like bentonite (TPI), RPM of pelletizer disc, inclination of disc, water feed rate etc, ensuring consistent product quality and efficiency.
